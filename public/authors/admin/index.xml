      <description>&lt;p&gt;Choosing a college major sounds simple on paper. Pick something. Study it. Graduate. Move on with life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In reality? It’s one of the most stressful decisions students face.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You’re often asked to decide &lt;em&gt;what you want to do with your life&lt;/em&gt; before you’ve even had a real job. Advice comes from everywhere—parents, teachers, friends, TikTok, random rankings online—and most of it contradicts itself. One person says “follow your passion.” Another says “pick something practical.” Someone else says your major doesn’t matter at all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;this-isnt-a-yes-or-no-question&#34;&gt;This Isn’t a Yes-or-No Question&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Should I go to college?” sounds like a simple question. It isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For years, students have been told that college is the &lt;em&gt;default&lt;/em&gt; path. Go to class, get good grades, apply, enroll, and everything will work out. If you don’t go, something must be wrong. That story is everywhere — in schools, in families, in movies, even in casual conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But here’s the honest truth: college isn’t automatically good or bad. It’s a tool. And like any tool, it only works well if it fits the person using it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As students pursue careers within a particular discipline, college majors have a considerable impact on their career paths and lives. College minors should be considered equally carefully by undergraduate students, according to experts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;College majors comprise structured coursework within an area of study chosen by the student. It is possible for students to take upwards of 30 hours of courses depending on their major and school. A minor, on the other hand, typically has six to seven courses requiring 18 credit hours.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
