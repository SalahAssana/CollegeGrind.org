      <description>&lt;p&gt;Choosing a college is one of the most consequential decisions a person makes—yet it&amp;rsquo;s often reduced to a single dimension: prestige. In reality, the &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; college depends entirely on fit: the alignment between a student&amp;rsquo;s goals, learning style, financial reality, and life circumstances, and what an institution offers. This guide moves beyond rankings to help readers understand which type of college and what specific factors matter for &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; success.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;redefining-what-makes-a-college-good&#34;&gt;Redefining What Makes a College &amp;ldquo;Good&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-myth-of-the-best-college&#34;&gt;The Myth of the &amp;ldquo;Best&amp;rdquo; College&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is no universally &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; college. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.brookings.edu/articles/beyond-college-rankings-a-value-added-approach-to-assessing-two-and-four-year-schools/&#34;&gt;A prestigious name may confer initial credibility, but research consistently shows that institutional prestige alone predicts relatively little about long-term satisfaction or career success.&lt;/a&gt; What matters far more is whether the college helps &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; achieve your goals while supporting your wellbeing and values.​&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_minor&#34;&gt;A college minor is a secondary area of study that you can pursue alongside your major&lt;/a&gt;, but critically, one that is entirely optional. Unlike a major, which is required for graduation and typically demands 30 to 60 credit hours, a minor is a complementary credential that usually requires 16 to 30 credit hours of coursework, or roughly five to seven classes. Minors are most prevalent in the United States and provide students with a structured way to explore academic interests, build skills, or deepen knowledge in a field beyond their primary focus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What should you study in college? How to choose a major</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Choosing a college major sounds simple on paper. Pick something. Study it. Graduate. Move on with life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In reality? It’s one of the most stressful decisions students face.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You’re often asked to decide &lt;em&gt;what you want to do with your life&lt;/em&gt; before you’ve even had a real job. Advice comes from everywhere: parents, teachers, friends, TikTok, random rankings online. Much of that advice contradicts itself, with one person saying “follow your passion” another saying “pick something practical” and someone else saying your major doesn’t matter at all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Should I go to college? A question-first guide for high school students</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;this-isnt-a-yes-or-no-question&#34;&gt;This Isn’t a Yes-or-No Question&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Should I go to college?” sounds like a simple question. It isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For years, students have been told that college is the &lt;em&gt;default&lt;/em&gt; path. Go to class, get good grades, apply, enroll, and everything will work out. If you don’t go, something must be wrong. That story is everywhere — in schools, in families, in movies, even in casual conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But here’s the honest truth: college isn’t automatically good or bad. It’s a tool. And like any tool, it only works well if it fits the person using it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
