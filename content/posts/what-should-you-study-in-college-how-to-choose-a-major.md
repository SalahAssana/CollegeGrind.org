What you choose to study in college can make or break your career life. Choose the wrong course combination and you’ll likely end up with an unbearably hard struggle during your academic years. And even if you’re lucky to complete the course, chances are that you’ll end up disliking your eventual career only to end up struggling with performance and all kinds of job satisfaction-related complaints. 
Long story short, the choice of what to study in college should be informed based on several factors key among them:

- Your natural abilities and talents
- Your passion and interests
- Your future career goals

Sounds complicated? Worry not. We'll help break down the nitty-gritty of choosing the right college major with this guide.

## Part 1: What Are You Good At?

One of the best ways to understand what you really are good at is by asking yourself (and probably those who are around you) some questions regarding what you naturally excel at. Here’s how to go about it:

### Understanding Your Natural Skills and Talents

Not sure what to major in at college? Start by identifying your natural skills and talents. Think about the things you have enjoyed in the past or easily excelled at.

Also, consider what you enjoy during your free time – do you mostly find yourself browsing on social media and following the latest trends? Perhaps a career in digital strategy might be what you need to aspire for.

Or maybe you often find yourself listening to podcasts on mental health and are pretty good in Biology – you might want to consider majoring in something in the health sciences or psychology.

In a nutshell, before you opt for any college course, it’s important to first understand yourself and what you truly are good at.

### Strength and Weaknesses

Each and every person in this world has their fair share of strengths and weaknesses. And so, it’s important to have a self-evaluation moment whereby you get to face these two sides of you so you get to appreciate the beauty that is your traits.

A good way to go about this is by rating some of your day-to-day or academic-related activities from easiest to hardest. For example, do you find it easier to assemble new furniture from the store than to create some from scratch in the garage? Chances are that you are better off taking a career path that typically involves routine tasks as opposed to one that involves creating things from scratch.
If self-evaluation alone doesn’t do the trick, try to ask within your circles. People who know you very well are likely to have useful clues that could help you better understand your positive and negative traits.

### How Rigorous Will the Major’s Coursework Be?

While there’s nothing like an easy college course, some have the reputation of being exceptionally challenging.  Rigorous programs often require you to spend long hours in the lab or at the library carrying out research.

Courses that require long hours of study time can be especially draining especially if you have a part-time job or are running a side hustle.

By asking yourself how many hours you’re willing to dedicate to your college education, it’s possible to understand what course to choose.

### What Are Your Math Capabilities

Math is easy for everyone! Said no one ever. While some students find this subject easy and fun, quite a few others struggle with it to a point of getting embarrassed. As part of the preparation for your college major, it’s important to take your mathematical prowess into account.

Courses like engineering, coding, accounting, and mathematics involve lots of math. So, you might want to avoid them if this isn’t your 
strong point.

### What Are Your English Capabilities

Academic English is slightly different from the everyday English that we use informally. So, just because you can speak the language fluently doesn’t mean that you can comfortably take on any major that requires lots of academic English input.
If English has never been your favorite, you might want to avoid courses like English Literature, Law, and Linguistics to mention but a few.

## Part 2: What Do You Like?

Mark Twain once said, "Find a job you enjoy doing, and you'll never have to work a day in your life." Likewise, when zeroing in on the right college major you want to go with something you like so you can enjoy every bit of it.

### What Are Your Passions and Interests?

Before you can pursue something you’re passionate about, you need to start by discovering what your passion really is. Your passion is something you yearn for and often want to do constantly.

When choosing the college major of your dreams you want to identify what you are enthusiastic about – something that motivates you to figure things out, make a change, or learn faster.

### Is There Something You’re Interested in Learning More About?

The desire to learn, discover and unravel mysteries is the fuel that has driven some of the most notable human achievements and discoveries throughout history. Likewise, you can tap into this desire to understand what you should study in college.

Have you got a desire for improving other people’s social lives? You might want to look for a humanity-based major. Have you got a burning desire for making life easier for everyone? Something in the engineering or tech space might do the trick.

### What Subjects Do You Enjoy?

Still not sure what major to pursue? Your high school diploma certificate and transcript might have the clues. Ideally, you should go with something you enjoy and also excel at. So, if you enjoy studying Biology and have a good grade to show for it, this might just be the game-changer you need as you choose what to major in.

## Part 3: What are your Career and Education Goals?

Aligning your career and education choices is perhaps the best thing you can do to guide your focus. Think about what you would like to achieve in your life in the long haul. Reflect on what you would ultimately want to accomplish in life. This deeply personal process can go a long way in getting the major that helps you actualize your dreams.

### How Much Education Do You Need?

Basically, you want to go with a major that aligns with your future goals with the least effort possible. That said, there is nothing like a one-size-fits-all answer to how much education one needs to excel in their career. So, the best thing to do is to understand things like the length of the coursework involved, how long the research task is likely to take, and above all, whether an associate degree is all you need or further advancement to a Bachelor’s, Master’s, or Doctorate degree might be necessary.

Some areas of practice may need you to go well beyond your associate's degree while others are more accommodating and would even accept you while you're still at school.

In a nutshell, it boils down to what goals you want to accomplish in life and how much academic effort is needed to align your education with those goals.

### What Does the Major Prepare You For?

It’s easy to choose the major with the fanciest name available or one that’s popular among your peers – but if you’re not versed with information on what the major prepares you for you might be in for a rude surprise. Remember, the major you settle for will eventually determine what fields you will be able to join later on in life.

A misguided choice might have you pursue a major that prepares you for an undergraduate degree in a field that’s of little interest to you.

### What’s The Job Stability?

With unemployment levels being high and cases of companies laying off their staff becoming the norm, you’re better off selecting a major that enables you to find a career in the most stable sector of the economy.

If you can’t stomach uncertainties or infrequent changes in your future work environment then it makes sense to go for a major that leads you to the most stable career field available.

### What Are your Income Expectations?

Yup, you read that right. Your choice of a major can (and will) shape your future earnings. As such, going for a high-return major might be a good idea if financial prosperity is your ultimate goal.

Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics suggests that careers in medicine, engineering, and airline pilot fields are some of the highest-paying ones currently. So, if your high school score allows it and you desire to have a well-paying job someday, choosing a major that aligns you with one of these fields might be a good idea.

## Conclusion

In summary, choosing the right college major can have a major impact on your future career, goals, and job satisfaction. One should carefully consider their academic abilities, talents, passion, and long-term goals when arriving at the final decision. Conducting a self-evaluation of your strengths and weaknesses as well as seeking assistance from those who surround you can all be helpful in finding the perfect fit.
