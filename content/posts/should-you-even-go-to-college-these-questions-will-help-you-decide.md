Thanks to ever-changing economic conditions, worsening student debt, rising costs, and uncertain political outlook for the foreseeable future, many students in the US are questioning the viability of attending college.

Though it's true that college is the right decision for an always-narrowing scope of students, and alternatives are more viable than ever, it's still a question that you must take seriously.

Part of the process for evaluating whether you should go to knowledge is determining what your future career path will be and what your budget is.

If you find yourself questioning: "Should I Go To College?", you're in the right place. These crucial self-reflecting questions will help you to determine whether college is the right choice for you.

## Do You Want To Go Or Do Others Expect You To Go?

The first question you should ask yourself is: "Do I want to go to college or do others expect me to go?"

It's easy to get wrapped up in what your parents want for you, what your friends are doing, or what you think you're supposed to do.

But at the end of the day, you're the one who has to make this decision.

There's no sense in going to college if it's not something that you want to do. You'll likely feel out of place, won't do well, and will end up wasting a lot of time and money.

## Do You Know What You Want To Study?

A lot of people go to college without having any idea what they want to study. And that's okay! College is a great place to explore different interests and figure out what you want to do with your life. But if you have no idea what you want to study, you might want to consider taking some time off before going to school. You can use that time to work, travel, or take classes at a community college to help you figure out what you want to study.

## Do You Have a Post-College Plan?

What are you going to do after you graduate from college? It's important to have a plan for after graduation because let's face it: the real world can be tough. If you're not sure what you want to do after college, that's okay! But you should at least have an idea of the kind of career you want to pursue. If you don't have a good idea of what that will look like, then you might want to take some time and consider it.

## Do You Enjoy Being In An Academic Environment?

College is a lot of work. There are classes, homework, group projects, and exams. And if you're not used to being in an academic environment or dislike an academic environment, it can be tough to adjust. So if you're not sure if you'll enjoy being in a college setting, it might not be the right decision for you!

## Do You Want Real World Experience?

College is great for a lot of reasons, but what it doesn't usually provide is a lot of real-world experience. Some careers are better suited for getting your hands-on experience right away. You may want to consider a technical college if you prefer to jump right into it and you are pursuing a career that can be taught at a technical college.

## Do You Have The Ability To Pay For College?

You might be so caught up in wondering if you should go to college, that you haven't actually considered whether you can afford to go to college. College is expensive and it's only getting more expensive by the year. You should not only consider whether you have the means to pay for tuition, but also whether you can afford to pay back any loans that you take out after you graduate.

## Do You Have The Academics To Be Admitted?

A key determining factor for admittance to college is your academics and testing scores. If you have poor testing scores, you might not be able to be admitted to a college that you like. It may be worth considering taking some time off to study and re-test to try and get higher scores so you can have your pick of colleges.

## Let's Recap

The prospect of going to college can be intimidating and difficult to some. By asking yourself these questions, you have started yourself on the path to truly understanding whether you want to go to college and which circumstances should guide you toward that decision.
