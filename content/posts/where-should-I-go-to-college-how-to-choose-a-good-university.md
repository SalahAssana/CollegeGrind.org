## Type of College

Selecting a university where you will pursue your higher education is a big deal. This article is a guide to help you make that decision. The first thing to consider is the type of college you’d like to attend. The different types of colleges you can select from include; public or private colleges, for-profit colleges, 4-year or 2-year colleges, vocational training and career colleges, universities or community colleges, colleges with a special interest (single-sex colleges, specialized mission colleges, arts colleges or religion affiliated colleges) or liberal arts colleges. 

Public universities are universities funded by the state or local government. The tuition fees here are usually lower compared to private universities and the student body is more diverse. Private universities, on the other hand, have varying sizes and their main focus is usually to build a cohesive student body. Private universities are funded through private sources and the tuition fees students pay. 

Vocational technical and career schools, also known as trade schools, are schools that train a student in a specific career or industry like culinary arts, medical records technology, firefighting and dental hygiene. A student usually receives a certificate or associate’s degree upon completion. 

4-year colleges offer programs that run for four years and 2-year colleges offer programs that run for two years. Upon graduating from a 4-year college, which includes universities and liberal arts colleges, a student receives a bachelor’s degree. And, upon graduating from a 2-year college, which includes community colleges and vocational-technical and career colleges, a student receives a certificate or an associate’s degree. 

So, decide if you’d like a 4-year college like, universities or a 2-year college like community colleges. After that decide if you prefer a public or a private school.

## Academic Interest

You’ve settled on the type of college you want. So, does the school offer the major you’re interested in? Make sure the school you settle for offers the program you want to study. It is important to note that many small colleges may not have major engineering and business programs, for instance, while vocational schools may not always offer a variety of humanities classes. If you haven’t figured out what you want to study, it is wise to still research the program options you’ll have in the school you’re interested in. 
Choosing a college is oftentimes centered on the program or course you want to study and the career you’re hoping to get into after you graduate. Universities and colleges do not all offer the same programs so, investigating to find out if the school you’ve chosen offers your course is important.

Besides checking if the program you want is available, also research the details of the program like its modules and if the module you’d like to specialize in, is available. Also, you might want to look into the professors teaching the program to see if they are at the forefront of any innovative research or if they inspire you. 

Thoroughly investigate the specific departments and faculties of the program you’re looking to study. Research on the elective courses taught in the school. Elective courses are specific programs that students choose for themselves and they are required for graduation as they count towards the credits. Elective courses are, however, not a requirement for your specific degree of study.

After checking whether the school offers the program you want and investigating the departments and faculties, check whether the classes are mainly lectures or discussions. The primary mode of teaching in most universities is lecturing with some classes being discussions. Also, confirm the learning options you’ll have; if it’s either online or remote. Traditionally, universities have had the remote learning aspect, but after the Covid-19 pandemic, most schools adopted the online mode of learning. Therefore, confirm if the program will be taught remotely, online or through a blended learning approach. A tip to help you get a feel of what online learning in the school you’re considering would be is to try some of the school’s short online courses. 

Also, find out about the school’s academic culture and if the students are generally competitive or collaborative. Attending a few classes during a campus tour will help you understand this.  

## Consider the study abroad opportunities

A lot of universities and colleges give their students a chance to study abroad for a semester or one year. If this option is appealing to you, you might want to look into the kinds of opportunities you’ll get in the school and the major you’re interested in. As you research, look into the language requirements you might need, whether or not you’ll have your credits transferred to your major and the kind of support you will receive from the school when you study abroad. Some colleges will offer work placements abroad where the student gets credits for the time they spent on the job. You can gain valuable work experience from these opportunities, that’ll boost your CV however, be prepared for tough competition for these opportunities. 

## Location

Location is also another important factor to consider when selecting a university. With all the options you have nationally and worldwide, location is a smart way to narrow down your university search. For the location, ask yourself if you want to stay near home or go far away, stay within your state or go out of the state, do you want a vibrant city experience or a laid-back rural area experience? These questions will help you decide the location of your school.
The location you settle on is important for reasons like; the travel time back home, general atmosphere and available local amenities, travel time to a weekend job and the social scene and nightlife of the area.

## The Student Body

Another way to slim down your options for colleges and universities is to think about the kind of student body size and composition you’d like to be in. Do you want a bigger student body than what you’ve experienced in your high school or a smaller college campus? Look into the student composition and see whether you’d be comfortable in it or fit in. If possible, a campus tour and seeing how many students are in the university and what they look like will answer all these questions for you.

## Consider the campus organization, life and culture

Investigating what the college experience is like through ways such as talking to current students, admission experts and campus representatives and researching online will help you narrow down your search. Find out what students in the university do for fun, what the popular on and off-campus extracurricular activities are, if students participate in sororities and fraternities and if many students go home on weekends.

Besides studying, enjoying your campus experience, making friends, getting involved in activities you love and building networks with other students are also important. Additionally, find out what else is offered in the area that is not connected with the school. 

## Cost and Financial Aid

Considering the cost you will incur to study at a specific college or university is crucial and is a fantastic way to quickly narrow down your search. Investigate the amount you’ll be required to pay for tuition, books and supplies, housing and meal plans and any other additional costs. Most colleges offer aid calculators on their websites to help you estimate the amount you need to pay, how much you need in student loans and the estimated amount that can be made in work-study.

Research the scholarships, financial aid packages and merit aid packages offered by the school. University is expensive, but choosing a university that doesn’t have an expensive cost of living will save you a lot of cash. Look if the school has co-op internships and how much you can expect to earn and part-time on-campus jobs. Note that there is a difference between grants and scholarships and loans. Grants and scholarships are free money while loans will have to be paid back eventually. Some students, however, do receive generous scholarships or financial aid packages that they don’t have to take out student loans. 

## Career Preparation

As you carry out your research, look into how the school can help you find and prepare for a career path. Some of the ways to help you judge are to look at the university’s alumni network and the kind of internships students get. Visiting the career centre during your campus visit will also help.

Some universities and colleges advertise that they have connections within certain industries and this may help you get an internship or work placement with the company of your dreams or similar opportunities. Investigating the employment rates of the university’s graduates can also help with your decision-making. If you’re not able to find this information on the school’s website, you can reach out to the program leader directly to find out.

Students are encouraged to ask questions about the counsellor-to-student ratio, job fairs and on-campus interviews. See whether the career centre offers helpful services like helping students develop soft skills, conducting mock interviews, providing employment and salary data, teaching about the hiring processes, encouraging internship leads and building connections with alumni. Make sure the school you select has enough resources to help you with your career preparation. 

## Housing and Dining

Look into the housing options that exist in the school and if there are 4 years of guaranteed housing or if students have to move into off-campus accommodation after their junior year. And if students have to move into off-campus rentals, how much is the rent? What are the lease conditions? Are they shared spaces? What will the cost of utilities be? These are the things that will impact your daily college experience heavily.

If you’ll need to share the accommodation facility with others, be sure to select your roommates wisely and also ensure the place has enough space to provide privacy to everyone.  Check how amenities like bathrooms, toilets, air conditioning and WiFi work. Your accommodation should complement your personality.

For dining, check whether students eat in the dining halls or if they have to buy food around campus. Investigate whether your dietary needs will be met, what the meal plans are and if the students have a say in what is being served. Most schools offer comment cards for this. Check whether you need to pay for dining services and how much it’ll be. 

## Admission Requirements

Check whether the institution has staff to help you with the admissions process and find out if the school is concerned about your passions and experience aside from test results. Look for an institution with an admission process that reflects the values you want to see in a school and a staff that is invested in your success. The admission requirements and the process is a way for you to learn more about the university. 

## Consider the Standardized Testing Requirements and course requirements

Make sure you pay attention to the university’s standardized testing requirements although some colleges are test-optional, meaning that you’re not required to submit any ACT or SAT scores. So, look out for that as different colleges have different policies.
Also, consider the course requirements you need for the particular program you’re interested in. These might include grades, relevant test scores and other educational statistics. 

## Education Statistics

Consider the graduation, retention and acceptance rates. 

The graduation rate shows the number of students who complete a program and graduate after 2, 4 or 6 years. The retention rate shows the percentage of first-time students in their first year who continue in that school for the next year. The acceptance rate will show you what percentage of students who applied to that school are accepted. A simple Google search should give you all this information about the school you’re interested in.
